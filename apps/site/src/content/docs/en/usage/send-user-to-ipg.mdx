title: Send user to the IPG
description: Step 2 out of the 3 steps of payment
---

import { Code } from 'astro:components'

In this step you should send the user to the payment page using the data you got back from the `requestPayment` method.

As mentioned in the previous page, the returned value contains the following:

- `url`: The url that you should send the user to.
- `method`: The method with which you should send the user with. Can be `GET` or `POST` depending on the driver.
- `params`: The data that you should send the user with.

To send the user, create a form on the client-side and...

1. set its `action` attribute to the url.
2. set its `method` attribute to the method.
3. add the params data as `input` elements.

:::tip
If you serve your pages from backend (not using a SPA), you can use the `getScript` method on `paymentInfo` and automate the mentioned process. Like so:

```js
res.send(
  `<html>
    <body>
        <h1> We're redirecting you to the payment gateway... </h1>
        <script>${paymentInfo.getScript()}</script>
    </body>
  </html>`
);
```
