import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"
import { verifySnippets } from "../../../snippets/verify.ts"
import { Code } from 'astro:components'

The `verifyPayment` method accepts 2 arguments:

1. an object, containing `amount` and `referenceId` of transaction.
2. request parameters in the callback route

<Code code={verifySnippets.ts} lang="ts" />

This method returns you a `receipt` that will contain a `transactionId` and a `cardPan` and some other info about the payment.
At this point the payment process is finished and you can provide your service/product to the user.

:::note
the `verifyPayment` function might throw `VerificationException`
